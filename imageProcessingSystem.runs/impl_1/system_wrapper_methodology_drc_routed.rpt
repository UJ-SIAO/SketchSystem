There is a large setup violation of -6.662 ns between system_i/Sketch_IP_0/inst/conv1/i_pixel_data_light_s2_reg[2][1]/C (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and system_i/Sketch_IP_0/inst/conv1/curved_data_reg[2][3]/D (clocked by clk_fpga_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock system_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin system_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
